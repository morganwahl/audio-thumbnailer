To install a thumbnailer for .mood files:

Add .mood files to the mime-info-database by 

  copying moodbar.xml to /usr/share/mime/packages and running `update-mime-database`

  OR

  copying it to ~/.local/share/mime/packages and running `update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime`


See the install_thumbnailers.sh script to add the gconf keys for mood files and various audio formats.


To build moodbar, you need fftw3-dev and gstreamer0.10-dev packages on ubuntu.
